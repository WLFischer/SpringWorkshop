* " https://www.webjars.org[webjars] are client-side web libraries packaged into JAR files"
* no need to manually put single files into resource folders
* instead insert into project using Maven
* in this project: BootstrapCSS and JQuery
* both not latest version to keep course compatible with what John Thompson showed
* difference to _05_SpringMVCHelloWorld:
** different styling
** (viewed from browser) source code of page
** backend implementation
* different use cases commited in multiple commits:
** listing all products in a table (without actual database, that's simulated via a HashMap)
** generating a link for each product to see it in detail
