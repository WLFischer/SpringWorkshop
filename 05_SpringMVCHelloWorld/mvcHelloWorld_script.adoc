- Spring module dealing with web requests, REST services and SOAP-Services
- MVC = design pattern to separate concerns. So don't let the view make database requests or your controllers talk to other web services!
- MVC uses dispatcher servlet to handle requests:

image::dispatcherServlet1.png[]
Client has a request

image::dispatcherServlet2.png[]
Request is accepted by Dispatcher Servlet

image::dispatcherServlet3.png[]
Dispatcher Servlet determines matching controller for request ...

image::dispatcherServlet4.png[]
and forwards request.

image::dispatcherServlet5.png[]
Controller may call a service for business logic, ...

image::dispatcherServlet6.png[]
which itself can call a data layer.

image::dispatcherServlet7.png[]
The result is returned to the controller.

image::dispatcherServlet8.png[]
The resulting model is returned to the Dispatcher Servlet ...

image::dispatcherServlet9.png[]
and gets forwarded to a view.

image::dispatcherServlet10.png[]
The data-injected view is returned to the Dispatcher Servlet ...

image::dispatcherServlet11.png[]
to be returned to the client.

- developer only has to implement controllers, views and services (others provided by Spring):
