== Dependency Injection & Inversion of Control
* Spring manages dependencies
* dependencies can be composed at runtime instead of compile time. Often-seen example in legacy code: data-sources hardwired to classes using them.

== Types of DI
* Two types:
. constructor-based
. setter-based

* interface-based DI: best practice to code dependencies to an interface, for more flexibility in testing
