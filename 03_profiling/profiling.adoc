- different profiles cause different beans to be injected

== Default profiles
- if profile in service-impl-classes is "default", this implementation is chosen if no active profile is set in properties-file (and gets overridden if there is a profile in the properties file)
- an implementation can be default and additionally named:


    @Profile({"default", "english"})
