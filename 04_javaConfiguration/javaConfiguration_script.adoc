- originally, Spring used XML-based configuration
- movement towards Java configuration
- today: everything possible with XML also possible in Java config
- Java config debuggable, huge plus
- Spring Boot sets up a component scan for the package that it's in
- in code for this section: _JavaConfigurationApplication_ moved to package _springboot_ so that automatic component scan will not detect other classes
- adding manual scan to _JavaConfigurationApplication_ solves this:


    @ComponentScan("demo")

- Moving declaration of _HelloWorldServiceEnglishImpl_ and _HelloWorldServiceSpanishImpl_ from these classes to new class _Config_

== Other concepts mentioned in the course
- @Primary to mark the primary interface in case of multiple candidates are found
- @Qualifier in combination with @Bean(name="xy") to autowire by name instead of by type
