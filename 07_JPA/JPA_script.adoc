== Overview
* First, a look at pure JPA. Then: Spring Data JPA.
* mapping object entities to relational tables
* Hibernate = JPA Implementation
* H2 Database (in-memory)
* DDL = Data Definition Language to create tables
* Hibernate can pre-populate database with DDL
* business objects become entity classes via annotations
* Spring enables database switches, for example from MySQL to H2 to HSQL

== JPA
* Java Persistence API
* standard in Java for ORM (Object relational mapping)
* JPA 1.0 in 2006
* most recent: JPA 2.1 (2013)
* JPA just an API standard!
* two big implementations:
** Hibernate
** EclipseLink

== Basic JPA-Concepts
* *JPA-Entity* = POJO = Plain Old Java Object = just properties, getters and setters
* *Entity Manager* = object used to persist / fetch objects from database
* *Transactions* allow rollback or commit, hence avoid partial transactions being persisted
* *Relationships:*
** OneToOne
** OneToMany (list)
** ManyToMany (two related lists)
** embedded (object stored within an object)
* *Criteria API* = Java-based API to write queries in Java (instead of SQL)
* *Data Access Object* = DAO = common design pattern for clean abstraction of dealing with EntityManager and transactions
* *Repository Pattern* = similar to DAO, but greater abstraction. Used by Spring Data JPA.

*Spring Boot creates all important beans automatically!* Normally, stuff like EntityManager and TransactionManagers would have to be created manually.

== Making "Product" an Entity
* Just add @Entity to class signature
* Spring Boot will perform a package scan and find the new entity
* because H2 is on the classpath, Spring Boot will start the H2 server while starting the application server
* also, tables will be created using the DDL created automatically
* after application server startup, table PRODUCT can be seen via http://localhost:8080/h2-console with jdbc:h2:mem:testdb, user name = "sa" and an empty password
* a lot of "magic" going on here, but everything can be modified

== Differences to former MVC-Project
* added dependencies to JPA and H2
* Make Product an entity
* enable H2 console in application.properties, can be reached at http://localhost:8080/h2-console with jdbc:h2:mem:testdb, user name = "sa" and an empty password
